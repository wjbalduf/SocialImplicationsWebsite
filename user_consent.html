            Data brokers are companies that are established on collecting user data to be sold.
            They can collect a variety of data, some of their favorites to collect are
            purchasing habits, health data, financial info, real-time location data (gathered from smartphone apps), and even inferred 
            info like political leanings, lifestyle choices, and religious beliefs.

            Data brokers collect this data often without user knowledge or consent.
            The only way to have this information deleted from data brokers is by contacting 
            them and requesting that they delete your information.
            This can be difficult as many data brokers do not have an easily accessable delete data button
