            When a user user deletes an account where does that deleted information
            most people would assume that when a post or comment on social media is deleted it is just removed from the database
            but in many cases companies use a practice called "soft deletions"
            soft deletions are when data in a databse is marked as deleted instead of actually being removed from the database
            This is something that is often explicitly stated in terms in services such as <a href="https://help.instagram.com/711062676142607" target="_blank"> instagram's privacy policy</a>
            they also state that it is subjected to its <a href="https://help.instagram.com/581066165581870?helpref=faq_content" target="_blank">terms of use.</a>
            having deleted content still be subjected to it's terms of use means that it is still able to be sold to third company parties for advertising purposes

            Companies such as instagram are not the only parties that collect and store user information
            there are many companies that solely exist to collect and scalp user data.
            <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/tips-tricks/what-is-a-data-broker/" target="_blank">Data brokers</a>  
            With many states not having strict internet privacy laws data brokers have free reign to collect any data they please.
            While it is possible to have this information deleted from the broker's database it is often very difficult to do so.
            a test on data brokers found that 35 data brokers <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Code_Injection" target="_blank">injected code</a> into their websites that hid there opt out pages searches,
            making it incredibly difficult to delete data that brokers have collected on users.
