        Data collection happens online through tools like cookies, pixels, and device fingerprinting, which can track users’ activities even across different devices and after leaving a site. Apps also use advertising identifiers to monitor behavior. Companies collect this data to personalize content, display targeted ads, and analyze user activity.

        <p>There are two types of tracking:</p>
        <p><strong>First-party tracking</strong> — done by the site a user visits directly.</p>
        <p><strong>Third-party tracking</strong> — done across multiple websites, mainly for advertising.</p>

      <div class="user-info">
        <p><strong>Social Contract Theory:</strong> Data collection is ethical only when it’s <em>consensual, transparent, and mutually beneficial</em>. It becomes unethical if hidden or manipulative — for example, when pixels continue tracking users after they leave a site without consent. This breaches privacy and breaks the social contract.</p>

        <p><strong>Kantian Ethics:</strong> Data collection is usually unethical because it often lacks <em>informed consent</em> and treats people as means for profit. Practices like device fingerprinting or selling app identifiers without the user’s knowledge violate Kantian duties of honesty and respect for individuals.</p>
