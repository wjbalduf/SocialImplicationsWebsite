        <p>
            there are many ways that users are able to protect themselves online 
            one of the best methods to is to avoid all websites that seem sketchy or that do not allow users to only
            use necessary cookies. It may seem obvious but it is the best method to prevent third-party-cookies from 
            tracking what you are searching for on websites.
        </p>

        <p>
            another great method is to just lie. When prompted to input information like a name or email 
            it is a great option to use burner names and emails for websites.
