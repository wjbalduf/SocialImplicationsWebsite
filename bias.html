        Understanding data bias is essential for fair and accurate analysis. Biases like <strong>selection bias</strong>, <strong>confirmation bias</strong>, <strong>label bias</strong>, and <strong>measurement bias</strong> can distort results and harm specific populations by supporting existing societal inequalities.

      <div class="user-info">
        <p>Selection bias occurs when datasets are not representative of the population, leading to skewed results</p>
      </div>
      <div class="user-info">
        <p>Confirmation bias happens when analysts favor data that supports prior beliefs while ignoring contradictory evidence</p>
      </div>
      <div class="user-info">
        <p>Label bias arises from pre-existing biases in labeled training data</p>
      </div>
      <div class="user-info">
        <p>Measurement bias is caused by inaccuracies in data collection methods</p>
      </div>
      <div class="Caption" id="bias-methods">
        <p>Methods to reduce bias include random sampling to prevent selection bias, diverse teams and blind analysis to counter confirmation bias, auditing labels and adversarial training to prevent label bias, and strong data validation for measurement bias.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="user-info" id="bias-ethics">
        <p>Both Rule Utilitarianism and Virtue Ethics emphasize bias reduction: Rule Utilitarianism focuses on outcomes and system fairness, while Virtue Ethics focuses on individual moral character. Together, they support both structural and personal ethical data practices.</p>
